def molecule_render(pdb):

    Function to visualize a 3D representation of a molecule based on its Protein Data Bank (PDB) string.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pdb : str
        A string representing the molecule in PDB format.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        The function does not return anything but visualizes the molecule using py3Dmol.

    # Zoom out slightly to make sure the entire molecule is visible. Takes two arguments: the zoom factor and the duration of zoom in milliseconds

def protein_fold(result):
    """
    Function to send a POST request with a Protein string/sequence to an external API (ESM Fold). The response is
    a PDB representation of the predicted protein structure, which is written into a file. The function then loads
    the structure from the file and calculates the mean B-factor. Finally, the protein structure is visualized.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : str
        The DNA sequence to send in the POST request.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        The function does not return anything but writes the response to a file and visualizes the protein structure.
