# DNA Analyzator

## Description
The DNA Analyzator is a Streamlit-based web application built with Python, designed to facilitate DNA sequence analysis and protein characterization. With this app, users can explore various functions for processing DNA data, including nucleotide counting, translation to protein sequences, visualization of protein structures, and classification of proteins based on its structure.


## Instalation and Running the app
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/bio_data.git
    ```
    
2. Install the required dependencies:
   
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  Run the Streamlit app from command line:

    ```
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

## Usage
1. Enter a DNA sequence into the input field provided on the app's interface.
2. Choose from the available options to perform nucleotide counting, translation to protein sequences, etc.
3. Click on Data Visualization to see 3D structure of your created protein.
